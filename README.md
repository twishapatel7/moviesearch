This project is a movie search app that uses the IMDB API. Users can search for a movie and filter using the year, and rating (either by searching for a specific year/rating or ranking it from high/low earlier/later). Users can also favorite movie titles and see them at the bottom of the page for later reference. 

I spent about 2-3 hours developing this project. I first planned out the features I wanted to incoporate, learned what data I could collect from the IMDB API, and then got straight into building. After some debugging and styling, I had a decently polished project. 

Currently the favoriting system uses local storage - if I was developing this for further use I would probably use Firebase since I'm familiar with it and have used it on past projects.
